here is **bold**
adding a [link](https://www.basicmillion.com)

here we have some inline code `x+y`

Bullet list:
* first
+ second
- third

Here's a numbered list:
1. first
2. second
3. third

python code block:
```
    import numpy as np

    def test_function(x,y)
      z = np.sum(x,y)
      return z
```

equations:
$$z=x+y$$
