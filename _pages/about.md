## Motivations
The ability to strategically innovate within an organisation whilst also
optimising valuable resources, who wouldn't want to engage in harnessing that
power?

To this aim I am seeking a place on a graduate scheme to
pursue the role of a data scientist. I look forward to further broadening my
expertise within essential languages such as SQL, Hadoop, Spark etc, with strong
emphasis on achieving **Python** mastery.

I first developed a passion for programming when introduced to MATLAB within an
engineering context. This passion continued to deepen as I became immersed
within the mathematical applications of Python throughout my Physics degree.

## Interests
With a strong interest in long term investing, I decided to create a financial
website during the summer of 2019. After briefly using WordPress to achieve
this, I chose to build the foundation myself by making use of HTML and CSS. I
later went on to learn the Django framework for Python, allowing me to build
upon the functionality.

## Background
I am currently a final year student studying a Bachelor of Science in
Theoretical Physics at Swansea University. Having averaged 87% in first year,
and 77% in second year, I am well on track to achieving a first class honours.

After obtaining my certificate of higher education (HECert) in Aerospace
Engineering at Swansea University, I made the transition into Physics to
satisfy my need for a deeper understanding about how and why things work.

## Skills
I have experience with languages such as Python, HTML/CSS, LaTeX, MATLAB, and
also frameworks such as Django.
