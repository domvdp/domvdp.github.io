I'm a final year student studying Theoretical Physics at Swansea University, and
have experience with languages such as Python, HTML/CSS, LaTeX, MATLAB, and also
frameworks such as Django.

I'm seeking a place on a graduate scheme to pursue the role of a data scientist,
and I intend to learn all relevant languages such as SQL, Hadoop, Spark etc, but
aim to achieve Python mastery.
