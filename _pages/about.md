I am currently a final year student studying a Bachelor of Science in Theoretical Physics at Swansea University. Having averaged 87% in first year, and 77% in second year, I am well on track to achieving a first class honours.

After obtaining my certificate of higher education (HECert) in Aerospace Engineering at Swansea University, I made the transition into Physics because I craved a deeper understanding about why things work.

I first developed a passion for programming when introduced to MATLAB within an engineering context. This passion deepened
when I became immersed in the mathematical applications of Python throughout my Physics degree.

When I discovered that LaTeX could produce very efficient high quality content, I began using it as a replacement to Microsoft Word. 

During the summer of 2019 I decided to create a financial website, and after briefly using WordPress to achieve this, I
chose to self-learn HTML and CSS so that I could make it my own. I later went on to learn the Django framework for Python, allowing me to make the website more functionable.

I have experience with languages such as Python, HTML/CSS, LaTeX, MATLAB, and also
frameworks such as Django.

I'm seeking a place on a graduate scheme to pursue the role of a data scientist,
and I intend to learn all relevant languages such as SQL, Hadoop, Spark etc, but
aim to achieve Python mastery.
